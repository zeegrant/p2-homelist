INTRO
Working in real estate one of the biggest complaints I recieve from renters and buyers is that they seen many properties that were not matching up to the listings and/or pictures. In other words, an illegal tactic was used called bait and switch. In order to prevent the prevelance of this occuring, adding peer reviews to each listing gives the buyers/renters a formal heads-up prior to booking an appointment with the listing agent. It helps to keep the broker community honest, limits wasted time searching for properties that don't fit the criteria and adds a layer of safety.
